Real Estate Flip Prediction with Feature Selection and City-Specific Models

This script predicts "Average Flip Days" for real estate properties in different cities using a linear regression model.

Requirements:

pandas
scikit-learn
joblib
Data Preparation:

Ensure your data is in an Excel file.
The data should have the following columns:
Numerical features potentially related to "Average Flip Days".
A column named "TRUE_SITE_CITY" to identify the city for each property.
A target variable named "Average Flip Days".
How to Use:

Replace the empty string '' with the actual filename of your Excel data file.

Run the script:

Bash

python real_estate_flip_prediction.py
Output:

The script prints results for each city:
Best combination of features used for prediction.
Model performance metrics (MSE and R-squared).
Best hyperparameters found (if GridSearchCV is used).
The script saves a separate pickle file (city_model.pkl) containing the best model for each city (identified by city name).
An additional pickle file (city_models.pkl) stores a dictionary containing all the city-specific models.
Error Handling:

The script checks for the presence of the required column ("TRUE_SITE_CITY") and handles missing data with imputation.
